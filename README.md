Enjoin ORM
==========

## Introduction

Enjoin is another PHP ORM (Object Relational Mapping) designed for [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com/) framework
and inspired by [Sequelize.js](http://sequelizejs.com/) ORM.
Enjoin uses active-record pattern.

Laravel has built in ORM, called [Eloquent](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/eloquent).
Unfortunately, there are some major disadvantages in Eloquent:

* Unable to construct associations via `join` clause
(see [Unable to Get Eloquent to Automatically Create Joins](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11099570/unable-to-get-eloquent-to-automatically-create-joins)).
* Unable to built in validation for model.
* Unable to order by eager loaded records. 

Enjoin relies on Laravel components, such as `Database` and `Cache`. 

## Installation

### Warning

Do not use this package in production because it still in heavy development phase.  

### Requirements

* PHP 5.4+
* Laravel 4.2+

### Via composer

Add `mightydes\enjoin` as a requirement to composer.json:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "mightydes/enjoin": "dev-master@dev"
    }
}
```

All models files should be in `Models` namespace, so create folder `app/models`,
and add to composer.json `autoload` section:
```json
"psr-4": {
    "Models\\": "app/models"
}
```

Update your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.

Once Composer has installed or updated your packages you need to register Enjoin with Laravel itself.
Open up `app/config/app.php` and find the providers key towards the bottom and add:
```php
'Enjoin\EnjoinServiceProvider'
```

Then add Enjoin Facade for easier access:
```php
'Enjoin' => 'Enjoin\EnjoinFacade'
```

Now you can access Enjoin in global namespace or in other namespace by adding:
```php
use Enjoin;
```

## Models

### Definition

Create `BaseModel.php` in `app/models` directory:

```php
<?php

namespace Models;

abstract class BaseModel
{

    // Connection name from `app/config/database` section.
    // You can use `default` string.
    public $connection;

    // Related table name.
    // You may pass this variable, and engine fills it automatically.
    public $table;

    public $timestamps = true;

    // Name for `createdAt` field (`created_at` by default).
    public $createdAt;

    // Name for `updatedAt` field (`updated_at` by default).
    public $updatedAt;

    public $cache = false;

    /**
     * @return array
     */
    public function getAttributes()
    {
        return [];
    }

    /**
     * @return array
     */
    public function getRelations()
    {
        return [];
    }

} // end of class
```

Each Enjoin model should be placed in `app/models` folder and extends `BaseModel` class.
